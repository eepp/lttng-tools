NAME
----
lttng-stop - Stop an LTTng tracing session


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*lttng* ['linkgenoptions:(GENERAL OPTIONS)'] *stop* [option:--no-wait] ['SESSION']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `lttng stop` command stops a tracing session, that is, it
deactivates the LTTng tracers for:

With the 'SESSION' argument::
    The tracing session named 'SESSION'.

Without the 'SESSION' argument::
    The current tracing session (see man:lttng-concepts(7) to learn more
    about the current tracing session).

See man:lttng-concepts(7) to learn more about tracing sessions.

The selected tracing session must be active (started; see
man:lttng-start(1)). A tracing session is inactive on creation (see
man:lttng-create(1)).

A `stop-session` trigger action can also stop a tracing session (see
man:lttng-add-trigger(1)).

Start an inactive tracing session with the man:lttng-start(1) command.

By default, the `stop` command ensures that the trace data of the
selected tracing session is valid before it exits. Make the command exit
immediately with the option:--no-wait option. In this case, however, the
traces(s) might not be valid when the command exits, and there's no way
to know when it/they becomes valid.

If LTTng archived the current trace chunk (see man:lttng-rotate(1) and
man:lttng-enable-rotation(1)) of the selected tracing session at least
once during its lifetime, the `stop` command renames the current trace
chunk subdirectory and prints the renamed path. Although it's safe to
read the content of this renamed subdirectory while the tracing session
remains inactive, it's :not: a trace chunk archive: you need to destroy
the tracing session with man:lttng-destroy(1) or perform a rotation with
man:lttng-rotate(1) to archive it.
