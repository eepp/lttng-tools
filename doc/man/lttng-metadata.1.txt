NAME
----
lttng-metadata - Regenerate LTTng tracing session metadata


SYNOPSIS
--------
Regenerate a tracing session's metadata:

[verse]
*lttng* ['GENERAL OPTIONS'] *metadata regenerate*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `lttng metadata` command manages a tracing session's metadata
generation options.

Regenerating a tracing session's metadata can be used to
re-sample the offset between the system's monotonic clock and
the wall-clock time.

This command is meant to be used to re-sample the wall-time
following a major NTP correction. As such, a system booting with
an incorrect wall-time can be traced before its wall-time is
NTP-corrected. Regenerating the tracing session's metadata
ensures that trace viewers can accurately determine the events
time relative to EPOCH.

LIMITATIONS
-----------
The `lttng metadata regenerate` command can only be used on kernel
and userspace tracing sessions (using per-UID buffers), in
non-live configurations.
