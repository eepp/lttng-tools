NAME
----
lttng-clear - Clear an LTTng tracing session


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*lttng* ['linkgenoptions:(GENERAL OPTIONS)'] *clear* ['SESSION' | option:--all]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `lttng clear` command clears one or more tracing sessions, that is,
it deletes the contents of their tracing buffers and of all their local
and streamed trace data.

See man:lttng-concepts(7) to learn more about tracing sessions.

The `clear` command clears:

Without any option::
    The current tracing session.
+
See man:lttng-concepts(7) to learn more about the current tracing
session.

With the 'SESSION' argument::
    The existing tracing session named 'SESSION'.

With the option:--all option::
    *All* the tracing sessions of the connected session daemon, as
    listed in the output of `lttng list` (see man:lttng-list(1)).
+
See the ``Session daemon connection'' section of man:lttng(1) to learn
how a user application connects to a session daemon.

If a tracing session is configured in snapshot mode (see the
nloption:--snapshot option of the man:lttng-create(1) command), the
`clear` command only clears the tracing buffers.

For a given tracing session, if at least one rotation occurred (see
man:lttng-concepts(7)), the `clear` command only clears its tracing
buffers and its current trace chunk, :not: its archived trace chunks.

NOTE: The nloption:--disallow-clear option and the
`LTTNG_RELAYD_DISALLOW_CLEAR` environment variable of
man:lttng-relayd(8) can disable remote clearing operations. If LTTng
sends tracing data over the network for the selected tracing session(s)
to an LTTng relay daemon configured as such, the `clear` command fails.
