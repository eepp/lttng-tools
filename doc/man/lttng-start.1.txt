NAME
----
lttng-start - Start an LTTng tracing session


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*lttng* ['linkgenoptions:(GENERAL OPTIONS)'] *start* ['SESSION']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `lttng start` command starts a tracing session, that is, it
activates the LTTng tracers for:

With the 'SESSION' argument::
    The tracing session named 'SESSION'.

Without the 'SESSION' argument::
    The current tracing session (see man:lttng-create(1) and
    man:lttng-set-session(1) to learn more about the current tracing
    session).

The selected tracing session must be inactive (stopped). A tracing
session is inactive on creation (see man:lttng-create(1)).

An active tracing session is an implicit recording event rule condition
(see man:lttng-enable-event(1)). In other words, a recording event rule
cannot match an event when its tracing session is inactive.

A `start-session` trigger action can also start a tracing session
(see man:lttng-add-trigger(1)).

Stop an active tracing session with the man:lttng-stop(1) command.
