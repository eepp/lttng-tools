This document explains how to write documentation for the LTTng-tools
C{nbsp}API.


== General rules

* Use four spaces to indent.

* Try to stay behind the 72^th^ column mark if possible.

* Use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space[`+&nbsp;+`]
  wherever needed.

* Refer to a function with the `func()` form and to an enumerator or
  type with the `#name` syntax.

* When you refer to any keyword or definition, use the `+\c+` command if
  it's a single word, otherwise surround the words with `<code>` and
  `</code>`:
+
--
----
@returns
    Event rule on success, or \c NULL on error.
----
--

* Use the `$$\$$__command__` style in text and the `@__command__` style for
  other locations (for example, `@brief`, `@param`, `@sa`, `@file`).

* Use a `@code{.unparsed}` block for a plain text block (shell input,
  for example):
+
----
@code{.unparsed}
$ lttng enable-event --all --kernel --syscall
@endcode
----

* In the text, use `\lt_p{__param__}` to refer to the parameter named
  `__param__`.


== Function documentation

Full example:

----
/*!
@brief
    Does something (third person singular, simple present) with some
    parameter \lt_p{param} unless some other parameter
    \lt_p{other_param} has some value.

Full documentation goes here and adds any relevant information that's
not in the brief description.

@code

----

Parts:

. **Opening Doxygen comment**.
+
Use `+/*!+`.

. **Brief description**.
+
Use third person singular in the simple present tense: you're
documenting what the function does. Assume that the sentence implicitly
starts with "`This function`".
+
Try to mention, briefly, all the parameters (with `\lt_p`) and what the
function returns.
+
End the sentence with a period.

. **Detailed description**.
+
Write complete sentences.
+
Refer to parameters (with `\lt_p`) as much as possible.
+
In general, keep paragraphs short: often, a single sentence is enough.
+
Refer to the documented function with "`this function`".
+
Write notes (`@note` command), remarks (`@remark` command), or
attentions (`@attention` command) when needed. Most notes and remarks,
however, can be simple paragraphs. Use `@parblock` end `@endparblock` to
have more than one note/remark/warning paragraph.

. **Parameter descriptions** (if any).
+
Use the `@param[in]`, `@param[out]`, and `@param[in,out]` commands
depending on the parameter direction.
+
Document parameters in the declaration order.
+
Refer to other parameters (with `\lt_p`) when useful for the reader.
+
End each description with a period.
+
Use `@parblock` end `@endparblock` to have more than one paragraph for a
given parameter description.
+
Make sure there's no blank line, except within a `@parblock` block,
within the parameter description block so that Doxygen puts all the
descriptions in the same section. For example, _don't_ write this:
+
----
@param[in] hexagon
    Ugh literally +1 aesthetic, fashion axe try-hard mixtape pork belly
    four loko.

@param[in] selfies
    Brooklyn ethical migas, viral edison bulb meggings butcher
    flexitarian letterpress humblebrag kombucha pour-over etsy sriracha
    blog.
----

. **Return value** (if any).
+
If the function returns a status code::
    Use the `@retval` command multiple times to document each relevant
    status:
+
----
@retval #LTTNG_SOME_STATUS_OK
    Success.
@retval #LTTNG_SOME_STATUS_SOME_ERROR
    Some error.
----
+
End each description with a period.
+
Use `@parblock` and `@endparblock` to have more than one paragraph for a
given return value description.
+
Make sure there's no blank line, except within a `@parblock` block,
within the return value description block so that Doxygen puts all the
descriptions in the same section. For example, _don't_ write this:
+
----
@retval #LTTNG_SOME_STATUS_OK
    Success.

@retval #LTTNG_SOME_STATUS_SOME_ERROR
    Some error.
----

If the function returns a simple value::
    Use the `@returns` command to document it.
+
Refer to parameters (with `\lt_p`) when useful for the reader.
+
End the description with a period.

. **Preconditions** (if any).
+
List all the function's preconditions with the `@pre` command or any
alias which starts with `@lt_pre`.
+
Use the simple present tense.
+
Do not write the word "`must`" as a precondition is already a
requirement.
+
End the description with a period.
+
Make sure there's no blank line within the precondition description
block so that Doxygen puts all the descriptions in the same section. For
example, _don't_ write this:
+
----
@lt_pre_not_null{param}

@pre
    \lt_p{param} is like this or like that.
----

. **Postconditions** (if any).
+
List all the function's _relevant_ postconditions with the `@post`
command or any alias which starts with `@lt_post`.
+
Anything that the body of the function documentation describes and which
forms the nature of the function doesn't need to be written as an
explicit postcondition. For example, if a function adds some
object{nbsp}A to some object{nbsp}B, don't write the postcondition
"`B{nbsp}contains{nbsp}A`".
+
Use the simple present tense.
+
End the description with a period.
+
Make sure there's no blank line within the postcondition description
block so that Doxygen puts all the descriptions in the same section. For
example, _don't_ write this:
+
----
@post
    The returned pointer is blue.

@post
    \lt_p{other_param} is still in some state, and woke jean waistcoat.
----

. **Items to see also** (if any).
+
Use the `@sa` command, multiple times if needed, to refer to related
functions or types.
+
This is a way for you to inform the reader about other existing, related
items. Keep in mind that the reader doesn't always know where to look
for things.
+
In the brief description of the referred item, _don't_ mention its
parameters, if any.
+
End each brief description with a period.
+
Make sure there's no blank line within the item description block so
that Doxygen puts all the descriptions in the same section. For example,
_don't_ write this:
+
----
@sa lttng_some_other_function() --
    Does something else with a parameter.

@sa lttng_another_function() --

== Writing style

The ultimate goal of the LTTng-tools C{nbsp}API documentation is to make
the layman write code using this API as fast and correct as possible
without having to ask for help. For this purpose, the documentation must
be as clear as possible, just like the function and type names try to
be.

Don't hesitate to repeat technical terms, even in the same sentence, if
needed. For example, if you document an "`event rule`", then always use
the term "`event rule`" in the documentation, not "`event`", nor
"`rule`", since they are ambiguous.

You can use light emphasis to show the importance of a part of the text
with the `\em` command (one word) or by surrounding the text to
emphasize with `<em>` and `</em>`. Likewise, you can use strong emphasis
when needed with the `\b` command (one word) or with `<strong>` and
`</strong>`. In general, prefer light emphasis to strong emphasis, and
use it economically.

Links to other parts of the documentation are very important. Consider
that the reader never knows that other functions exist other than the
one she's reading. Use as many internal links as possible. Use the
following forms of links:

`__func__()`::
    Automatic link to the function or macro named `__func__`.

`#__name__`::
    Automatic link to the type or enumerator named `__name__`.

`\ref __ref__`::
    Link to `__ref__` (page name, group name, function or macro name,
    type name, variable name, etc.) using its default text.

`\ref __ref__ "__some text__"`::
    Link to `__ref__` (page name, group name, function or macro name,
    type name, variable name, etc.) using the text `__some text__`.

See Doxygen's "`http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/autolink.html[Automatic
link generation]`" page for other ways to create automatic links.

Follow, as much as possible, the
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/style-guide/welcome/[Microsoft Style
Guide] when you document the API. This includes:

* Use an active voice.
* Use a gender-neutral language.
* Use the present tense (you almost never need the future tense).
* Address your reader directly (use "`you`").
* Use contractions ("`it's`", "`you're`", "`don't`", and the rest).
* Avoid anthropomorphism.
* Ensure parallelism in lists, procedures, and sentences.
* Terminate list items with a period, except when the list only contains
  very short items.
* Do not use Latin abbreviations.
* Use "`and`" or "`or`" instead of a slash.
* Avoid using negatives.
* Avoid using "`should`": most of the time, you mean "`must`", and
  that's very clear for the reader.
